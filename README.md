# Network-Analysis
## Introduction
For this project, you're going to pick three competing brands and do a network analysis of the tweets that are created that mention that brand. As you know, Twitter is an interesting place where people, bots and organizations all join the conversation. Your goal for this project is to better understand the chatter around each brand, what makes each brand unique, and what makes each brand different. We also will use network analysis to identify users that are most central to our brand and ones that are hyper interested in our product category in general (if you study Bud Light, Coors Light and Miller Light, your product category is light beer).
## Selecting Brands
Select three brands. Any set of three brand will do, as long as:
- They are competitive, that is, they sell similar products/services and compete for each other's business
- They are popular, that is people on Twitter must regularly talk about them
- There are at least 1.5k tweets for your brand (see fetching data below)
- The brand name is not broad or generic in the sense that it will yield ambiguous searches.
- Bird would be a bad brand name to try and retrieve for, Blue Bottle or adidas would be better
